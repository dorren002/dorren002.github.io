<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently studying at the School of Artificial Intelligence, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications(BUPT), advised by [Xueming Li](). And I graduated from the school of Digital Media and Designing Art, BUPT with a bachelor's degree in 2021.

I have great passion on generation models, and mainly interested in image generation like GANs and diffusion models. I have published a paper about GAN on old photo restoration task. And I have worked on Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) during my internship in Qcraft, that was mainly about reconstructing unbounded scenes using NeRF. Also I have payed some attention on large language models, but I haven't worked on that.

I participates open source community competitions and won some prizes, such as paddle implemented hand written formula recognition model _[CAN](https://aistudio.baidu.com/projectdetail/4922214)_ , wich is merged to the official repository of PaddleOCR.

I use Python most and familiar with the Pytorch, OpenCV, Numpy, Scipy and Matplotlib. And I also know some C/C++ programing skills, and worked as a software intern in Huawei.
